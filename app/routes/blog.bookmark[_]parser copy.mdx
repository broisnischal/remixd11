export const meta = ({ attributes }) => {
	console.log(attributes);

    return [
    	{
    		title: frontmatter.title,
    	},
    	{
    		description: frontmatter.description,
    	},
    ];

};

# How do you build {frontmatter.title} ?

If you haven't had looked what the exported bookmark file look like, here i show
how it looks like.

Ok, I guess now you will say what gibberish it is. But you also had the idea to
create the website, or some function, let me say a service worker, that syncs
your bookmarks with server, and publish that message to other browsers, to sync
all bookmarks.

Today, we are going to build the bookmark parser, first we are going to require
a package called [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org) to parse the html file.

I am using typescript, you can use whichever language you want, just be sure you
can parse a html file. maybe you can build a htmlparser from **C** ?

```tsx
interface Bookmark {
	title: string;
	url: string | undefined;
}
```

Here is a interface of Bookmark, i am not gonna include the icon, in today's
example, but feel free to include as per your need. You can find **ICON** in the
bookmark, data and ADD_DATE also in the file.

```tsx
export const parseBookmarks = (fileContent: string): Bookmark[] => {
	const $ = cheerio.load(fileContent);

	const bookmarks: Bookmark[] = [];
	$('a').each((index, element) => {
		const title = $(element).text();
		const url = $(element).attr('href');
		bookmarks.push({
			title,
			url,
		});
	});

	return bookmarks;
};
```

Here i have written a function to parse the bookmarks.

```tsx
const file = formData.get('bmrk') as File;

// const filecontent = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf-8');

const filecontent = await file.text();

const parsedBookmark = parseBookmarks(filecontent);
```

Reading the file content, and parse it, and return the bookmarks.
