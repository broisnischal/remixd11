See the demo of the snackbar that we are going to create in this article. We are
going a help of inbuilt Overlay widget by the flutter.

[Overlay](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Overlay-class.html) let
independent child widgets "float" visual elements on top of other widgets by
inserting them into the overlay's stack. The overlay lets each of these widgets
manage their participation in the overlay using OverlayEntry objects.

Also touch up, we are going to use the _`vibration`_ api of the device to add
the cake on the top, also I hope you like the design of the toast though I am
not the designer i have created a bit of design.

I am also going to use some common custom widgets for animation that i have
build, like `Shake Animation`, `Tap Animation` and `Swipable`.

```dart title="snackbar.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vms/api/vibration.dart';

import 'package:vms/common/widgets/shake_animation.dart';
import 'package:vms/common/widgets/swipable.dart';
import 'package:vms/common/widgets/tap_animation_widget.dart';

import 'package:vms/core/constants/color_constants.dart';
import 'package:vms/core/constants/text_style_const.dart';
import 'package:flutter_screenutil/flutter_screenutil.dart';
```

Color constants, text styles and flutter_screenutil are the optional libraries
that we are going to use.
