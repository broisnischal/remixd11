If you see a diagram that looks like this but you have vague understanding of
the ERD, then it is a good idea to read this blog and understand what does this
actually means and also how to design your database effectively.

### Database, RDBMS

I am not going through, what is database and what is RDBMS. I am assuming that
you might have already know the theorital definition of database, and have some
knowledge of it already.

### Database Design and Data Integrity

`Database Design` is the process of structuring a database in a way that meets
the needs of an organization, ensuring data is stored, managed, and retrieved
efficiently. Good database design is essential for building applications that
are scalable, maintainable, and performant. The design process involves defining
the database schema, which includes tables, fields, relationships, constraints,
and indexes.

Key principles of database design include:

1. Normal Forms ( Normalization)
2. Data Integrity
3. Entity-Relationship Modeling
4. Scalability
5. Performance Optimization and Reliability
6. Security and Privacy

Data Integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data
throughout its lifecycle. It ensures that the data stored in a database is
accurate and unaltered during operations like insertion, update, or deletion.
Maintaining data integrity is crucial for ensuring that the data in a database
remains trustworthy and meaningful, supporting accurate decision-making and
business operations.
`Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of data through the use of primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK).`

`Entity Integrity`: Ensures that each record in a database table is uniquely
identifiable. This is often achieved through primary keys, where each entry has
a unique identifier.

- **Example: In a User table, UserID serves as a primary key ensuring no two
  users have the same ID.**

`Referential Integrity`: Ensures that relationships between tables remain
consistent. Foreign keys are used to enforce referential integrity, ensuring
that a record in one table corresponds to a valid record in another table.

- **Example: If an Orders table references a CustomerID from a Customers table,
  referential integrity ensures that each CustomerID in the Orders table matches
  a valid CustomerID in the Customers table.**

`Domain Integrity`: Ensures that all data in a database field is valid according
to predefined rules, such as data types, formats, and ranges.

- **Example: A BirthDate field should only contain valid dates and not allow
  values like '2024-13-45'.**

`User-Defined Integrity`: Custom rules that enforce specific business logic
constraints, which might not be covered by the other three types of integrity.

**Example: A rule that ensures an OrderTotal must always be greater than zero.**

### Design Objectives

`Design Objectives` are the goals and criteria that guide the process of
creating effective and efficient systems, products, or structures. In the
context of software development and database design, these objectives ensure
that the final product meets user needs, performs well, and is maintainable over
time. Achieving these objectives involves balancing functionality, usability,
performance, and security.

`Flexibility, Reliability, maintainability, Compatibility, Usability, Functionality, and Scalability`
are the key design objectives.

## Terminology

<Hr />

### Table, Relation, file

A table (also known as a database schema) is a collection of related data
records, and it is the fundamental unit of data storage in a database. It is
also known as a database `schema`.

### Record, Row, Tuple

A record (also known as a database row) is a single row in a table, and it is
the fundamental unit of data storage in a database.

### Others

Value is information that is stored in a table or record. Entity/Object commonly
refers to a Table. like User, Order, Product, etc.

### SQL

Structured Query Language (also known as a database query language) is a
programming language that is used to communicate with databases.

- DDL - Data Definition Language
- DML - Data Manipulation Language
- DCL - Data Control Language
- TCL - Transaction Control Language

`SQL Keywords` - you should not name your database table with SQL keywords. For
example, `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `INSERT` is a SQL keyword.

### Fields

A field (known as an attribute in relational database theory) is the smallest
structure in the database, and it represents a characteristic of the subject of
the table to which it belongs. <KBD>Columns</KBD> <KBD>Atributes</KBD> is also a
field.

You'll typically encounter multiple types of fields in a database, or let's say
in improperly or poorly designed database.

- `Multipart fields` ( also known as composite fields ), it contains two or more
  distinct items within its value. i.e. **4879 Diamond Cove, Providence, Rhode
  Island, 02903**
- `Multivalued fields` which contains multiple instances of the same type of
  value.
- `Calculated fields` which contains a concatenated text value or the result of
  a mathematical expression.

#### Example of fields in user table

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>id</th>
			<th>name</th>
			<th>email</th>
			<th>dob</th>
			<th>age</th>
			<th>address</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>John</td>
			<td>john@m.com</td>
			<td>2001-01-01</td>
			<td>20</td>
			<td>4879 Diamond Cove, Providence, Rhode Island, 02903</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>Doe</td>
			<td>doe@a.com</td>
			<td>2006-02-01</td>
			<td>18</td>
			<td>4879 Diamond Cove, Providence, Rhode Island, 02903, USA, USA</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>Jane</td>
			<td>jane@s.com</td>
			<td>1999-01-01</td>
			<td>22</td>
			<td>4879 Diamond Cove, Providence, Rhode Island, 02903, USA</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

In the above table, you can see `Multivalued fields`, `Multipart fields`, and
`Calculated fields` errors.

- `Multivalued fields`: The **dob and age** field has multiple instances of the
  same type of value.
- `Multipart fields`: The **address** field has multiple distinct items within
  its value.
- `Calculated fields`: The **age** field is calculated from the dob.

## keys

In database design, keys are critical components that help ensure data
integrity, uniqueness, and relationships between tables. They are used to
uniquely identify records, enforce constraints, and establish links between
tables. Understanding the different types of keys is essential for creating
efficient and reliable database schemas.

### Types of Keys

- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures
  that no two records have the same value in this key.

  - **Example**: `UserID` in a `Users` table.

- **Surrogate Key**: An artificial key assigned by the system, often a
  sequential number, that has no real-world meaning but is used as a primary
  key.

  - **Example**: An auto-incrementing integer like `UserID`.

- **Natural Key**: A key that has a real-world meaning and is used as a primary
  key.

  - **Example**: A `SocialSecurityNumber` as a primary key.

- **Alternate Key**: A candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key. It
  is a unique key but not the main identifier.

  - **Example**: An email address in a `Users` table, when `UserID` is the
    primary key.

- **Super Key**: A set of one or more columns that can uniquely identify a
  record. Every primary key is a super key, but not all super keys are primary
  keys.

  - **Example**: `{UserID, Email}` together can be a super key.

- **Candidate Key**: A minimal super key, meaning no subset of it can uniquely
  identify a record. All candidate keys are potential primary keys.

  - **Example**: `UserID` or `Email` alone can be a candidate key.

- **Foreign Key**: A key in one table that links to the primary key in another
  table, establishing a relationship between the two.

  - **Example**: `OrderID` in an `Orders` table that references `UserID` in a
    `Users` table.

- **Not Null Key**: A key that must always contain a value, ensuring that a
  field is never left blank.

  - **Example**: `UserID` set as `NOT NULL`.

- **Simple Key**: A key that consists of a single column.

  - **Example**: `UserID`.

- **Composite Key**: A key that consists of two or more columns to uniquely
  identify a record.

  - **Example**: `OrderID` and `ProductID` together as a composite key in an
    `OrderDetails` table.

- **Compound Key**: Another term for a composite key, where multiple columns
  together form a unique identifier.
  - **Example**: `{FirstName, LastName, BirthDate}` as a compound key in a
    `Persons` table.

## Relationship

- **One-to-One**: A relationship between two tables where one table has a
  reference to another table.

- **One-to-Many**: A relationship between two tables where one table has a
  reference to many tables.

- **Many-to-Many**: A relationship between two tables where one table has a
  reference to many tables.

- **Many-to-One**: A relationship between two tables where one table has a
  reference to many tables.

## Understanding Entity Relationships Diagram

<Hr />
#### Cardinality and Modality

Cardinality refers to the number of instances of one entity that can be
associated with an instance of another entity. It defines the quantitative
aspect of the relationship between two entities. `Minimums and maximums`
`Help define the relationship in a numerical context. `

- **one to one**: 1-1

- **one to many**: 1-N

- **many to many**: M-N

![](/images/blog.database-design-part-first_2024-08-08-19-55-23.png)

- **Minimums**: The minimum number of instances that can be associated with an
  instance of another entity.

- **Maximums**: The maximum number of instances that can be associated with an
  instance of another entity.

Modality (also known as optionality) refers to the minimum number of instances
that must be involved in a relationship between entities. It defines whether
participation in a relationship is mandatory or optional.

### Indexes in Databases

Indexes in databases are data structures that improve the speed of data
retrieval operations on a table. They work like a book's index, allowing the
database to find rows quickly without scanning the entire table. There are
different types of indexes, each suited for specific scenarios.

**Think of an index as a bookshelf, or a phonebook with an index on the name.**

### Types of Indexes

#### 1. Clustered Index

A **clustered index** determines the physical order of data in a table. There
can be only one clustered index per table because the data rows themselves are
stored in the index order. When a table has a clustered index, it’s called a
clustered table.

- **Example**: Consider a `Users` table where `UserID` is the primary key. If
  you create a clustered index on `UserID`, the rows in the `Users` table will
  be physically stored in ascending order of `UserID`.

  ```sql
  CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_userid ON Users(UserID);
  ```

#### 2. Non-Clustered Index

A **non-clustered index** does not alter the physical order of the data in the
table. Instead, it creates a separate structure within the table that points to
the data rows. You can have multiple non-clustered indexes on a single table.

- **Example**: In the same `Users` table, if you frequently search by `Email`,
  you can create a non-clustered index on the `Email` column.

  ```sql
  CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_email ON Users(Email);
  ```

#### 3. Composite Index

A **composite index** (or **compound index**) is an index on two or more columns
of a table. It is used when queries often involve multiple columns in the
`WHERE` clause or in joins.

- **Example**: If you often query the `Users` table by both `LastName` and
  `FirstName`, you can create a composite index on these two columns.

  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_name ON Users(LastName, FirstName);
  ```

### Summary

- **Clustered Index**: Orders the physical data in the table and can only be one
  per table.
- **Non-Clustered Index**: Creates a separate structure for indexing without
  altering the data order; multiple non-clustered indexes can exist on a table.
- **Composite Index**: An index on multiple columns, useful for queries that
  filter by more than one column.

## Normalization

Database normalization is a design process used to organize a database into
tables and columns to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. The
primary goals are to:

- Eliminate redundant data
- Reduce Inconsistencies: Prevent anomalies in data operations (insert, update,
  delete).
- Easier to understand
- Easier to ehnance and maintain
- Protected from insertion anomalies, deletion anomalies, and duplication
  anomalies

We have different types of normalization. `1NF, 2NF, 3NF, 4NF, 5NF`

Ok, wth is it? you can think of it as a saftey level of a bridge, if we say 1NF
it means it have the saftey level of 1. If we say 2NF it means it has the saftey
level of 2. So on. Here in our case, if we say our database have the
normalization level of 3NF it means it has the saftey level of 3. I hope you got
the point if not we can go through examples to understand it.

### Example Table: Normalization

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce
redundancy and improve data integrity. The process involves dividing a database
into two or more tables and defining relationships between them. Below is an
example of how a table might be normalized through the first three normal forms
(1NF, 2NF, 3NF).

#### Unnormalized Table

Before normalization, let's consider an unnormalized table where data redundancy
exists:

**Orders Table**

| OrderID | CustomerName | CustomerAddress         | ProductName | Quantity | Price |
| ------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ----- |
| 1       | John Doe     | 123 Elm St, Springfield | Laptop      | 1        | 1000  |
| 1       | John Doe     | 123 Elm St, Springfield | Mouse       | 2        | 25    |
| 2       | Jane Smith   | 456 Oak St, Springfield | Laptop      | 1        | 1000  |
| 2       | Jane Smith   | 456 Oak St, Springfield | Keyboard    | 1        | 50    |

#### First Normal Form (1NF)

In the First Normal Form, each column contains atomic (indivisible) values, and
each entry in a column contains only one value. The table above already meets
1NF because all columns contain atomic values.

#### Second Normal Form (2NF)

In the Second Normal Form, the table must first meet 1NF, and all non-key
attributes must be fully dependent on the primary key.

To achieve 2NF, we separate the `Orders` table into two tables: `Customers` and
`OrderDetails`.

**Customers Table**

| CustomerID | CustomerName | CustomerAddress         |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| 1          | John Doe     | 123 Elm St, Springfield |
| 2          | Jane Smith   | 456 Oak St, Springfield |

**OrderDetails Table**

| OrderID | CustomerID | ProductName | Quantity | Price |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ----- |
| 1       | 1          | Laptop      | 1        | 1000  |
| 1       | 1          | Mouse       | 2        | 25    |
| 2       | 2          | Laptop      | 1        | 1000  |
| 2       | 2          | Keyboard    | 1        | 50    |

#### Third Normal Form (3NF)

In the Third Normal Form, the table must be in 2NF, and all the columns must
depend directly on the primary key. To achieve 3NF, any transitive dependency
(where a non-key column depends on another non-key column) must be removed.

For this example, let's split the `OrderDetails` table further to avoid
redundancy in product information.

**Products Table**

| ProductID | ProductName | Price |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- |
| 1         | Laptop      | 1000  |
| 2         | Mouse       | 25    |
| 3         | Keyboard    | 50    |

**OrderDetails Table (Revised)**

| OrderID | CustomerID | ProductID | Quantity |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- | -------- |
| 1       | 1          | 1         | 1        |
| 1       | 1          | 2         | 2        |
| 2       | 2          | 1         | 1        |
| 2       | 2          | 3         | 1        |

### Summary of Normalization

- **1NF**: Atomic values and no repeating groups.
- **2NF**: No partial dependencies (all non-key columns depend on the whole
  primary key).
- **3NF**: No transitive dependencies (non-key columns do not depend on other
  non-key columns).

By normalizing the tables, we have reduced redundancy and improved the integrity
of the data in our database.
