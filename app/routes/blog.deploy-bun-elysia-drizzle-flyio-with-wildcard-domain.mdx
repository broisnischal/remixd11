At first glance, What is mean by wildcard domain? And what is it used for? Let's
understand it thoroughly.

Wildcard subdomains open up many interesting possibilities for building dynamic,
user-centric web applications. Here are some project ideas that could leverage
wildcard subdomains effectively:

- Multi-tenant SaaS Platform (eg. Acme Inc.)
- Personal Portfolio Network
- Blogging Platform

Each user gets a blog at **broisnees.yourblog.com** Customizable themes and
layouts per subdomain, you can use the medium example.

- E-commerce Marketplace [ Sellers set up shops at shopname.yourmarketplace.com
  Unique storefronts and product catalogs per subdomain ]

You got what i mean, and you can also leverage wildcard subdomains to host your
own domain. we will go through how can we actually use it.

## Setting Up the Project

Projects includes multiple tools and technologies.

**Bun, elysia, neon serverless postgres, drizzle, flyio, cloudflare,
github_action, docker**

Let's create the project using the starting elysia command **bun create elysia
myapp**, after you initialized your project using elysia, you can run the
project then it should run on port 3000.

For `database` Today I am going to use the neon serverless postgres database
setup with drizzle orm, which is my favourite goto orm.

You can checkout the refrence repo of my
[Github.](https://github.com/broisnischal/merodocsbackend)

inside of the `src` folder you will find the `index.ts` file which is the main
entrypoint file. before it, we are going to create the `db` folder inside of the
src folder,

`db/index.ts`

```tsx
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http';
import * as schema from './schema';

if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
	throw new Error('Database credentials missing.');
}

export const sql = neon(process.env.DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL!);

const db = drizzle(sql, {
	schema,
});

export { schema, db };
```

also you should create the `drizzle.config.ts` in your root dir, if you are not
very familier with drizzle checkkout their
[docs.](https://drizzle-kit.com/docs/getting-started)

```tsx
// /drizzle.config.ts

import type { Config } from 'drizzle-kit';

export default {
	schema: './src/db/schema/index.ts',
	out: './drizzle',
	dialect: 'postgresql',
	dbCredentials: {
		url: String(process.env.DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL),
	},
	verbose: true,
	strict: true,
} satisfies Config;
```

Now we are going to create the `db/schema/index.ts` file inside of the `db`
folder.

```tsx
import { integer, pgTable, serial, text, timestamp } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

export const usersTable = pgTable('users_table', {
	id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
	name: text('name').notNull(),
	age: integer('age').notNull(),
	email: text('email').notNull().unique(),
});

export const postsTable = pgTable('posts_table', {
	id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
	title: text('title').notNull(),
	content: text('content').notNull(),
	userId: integer('user_id')
		.notNull()
		.references(() => usersTable.id, { onDelete: 'cascade' }),
	createdAt: timestamp('created_at').notNull().defaultNow(),
	updatedAt: timestamp('updated_at')
		.notNull()
		.$onUpdate(() => new Date()),
});

export type InsertUser = typeof usersTable.$inferInsert;
export type SelectUser = typeof usersTable.$inferSelect;

export type InsertPost = typeof postsTable.$inferInsert;
export type SelectPost = typeof postsTable.$inferSelect;
```

Ok we are now finished with the databse files, one last thing is to modify the
main entrypoint file, `src/index.ts`

```tsx
import swagger from '@elysiajs/swagger';
import { Elysia } from 'elysia';
import { db, schema } from './db';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';

export function getCname<T extends Request>(req: T) {
	return req.headers.get('host')?.split('.')[0];
}

const app = new Elysia()
	.use(swagger())
	.derive(({ request }) => {
		return { cname: getCname(request) };
	})
	.get('/', async ({ cname }) => {
		const user = await db.query.usersTable.findFirst({
			where: eq(schema.usersTable.name, cname!),
		});

		if (!user) return `You do not have the access.`;

		return `Hello, ${cname}`;
	})
	.listen(process.env.PORT!);

console.log(
	`ðŸ¦Š Elysia is running at ${app.server?.hostname}:${app.server?.port}`,
);
```

If you have noticed we have been using two environment which is `port` and
`DATABASE_URL`

```sh
# .env
PORT=8080
DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://yourvalidneonurl@ep-still-bush-a5e3y5t2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
```

We are done with setting up the code base. now we are going to deploy it.

If you don't have fly cli installed in your pc, use `brew install flyctl` to
install fly in your machine, or checkout [fly.io](https://fly.io) for more

```sh
fly launch
```

When using this command if you are not authorized it will ask you to login,
after login it will setup the configuration and as it detects the bun
application it setups the fly.toml file.

It will generate the dockerfile for you, if not here is the simple dockerfile
for bun

```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun as base
LABEL fly_launch_runtime="Bun"
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV="production"
# ENV DATABASE_URL=""
FROM base as build
RUN apt-get update -qq && \
    apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config python-is-python3
# Install node modules
COPY --link bun.lockb package.json ./
RUN bun install --ci
# Copy application code
COPY --link . .
FROM base
COPY --from=build /app /app
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "bun", "run", "dev" ] # Start the server by default
```

Also `fly lauch` will create the fly.toml file in your root directory. which
looks like this

```toml

app = 'mydocsbackend'
primary_region = 'ams'

[build]

[env]
PORT = '8080'

[http_service]
internal_port = 8080
force_https = true
auto_stop_machines = 'stop'
auto_start_machines = true
min_machines_running = 0
processes = ['app']

[[vm]]
memory = '512mb'
cpu_kind = 'shared'
cpus = 1

```

But before that we need to deploy the database, so we can use the deploy flag in
the fly.toml to run the migrate command and deploy the database

```toml
[deploy]
release_command = "bun run migrate"
```

Here is the package.json script

```json
 "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "dev": "bun run --watch src/index.ts",
    "migrate": "npx drizzle-kit migrate",
    "db:push": "bunx drizzle-kit push",
    "generate": "bunx drizzle-kit generate"
  }
  "dependencies": {
    "@elysiajs/swagger": "^1.1.0",
    "@neondatabase/serverless": "^0.9.4",
    "drizzle-orm": "^0.32.1",
    "elysia": "latest",
  }
```

you can use either db:push or migrate, db:push will push the db server, now we
are everything setup for deployment to fly io

```sh
#deploy the application
fly deploy
```

After successful deployment you should see and fly.io gives the hostname for
your application in my case it's **mydocsbackend.fly.dev** and you can access
your app

#### Cloudflare DNS and fly.io custom domain configuration

Go to your cloudflare account and click on **DNS** and then **Add Record**

![image](/images/blog.deploy-bun-elysia-drizzle-flyio-with-wildcard-domain_2024-08-04-10-23-29.png)

So where did i get this `ipv4` hostname from? It's from fly.io, if you go to
fly.io in your app dashboard you will see certificates

![](/images/blog.deploy-bun-elysia-drizzle-flyio-with-wildcard-domain_2024-08-04-10-25-55.png)

you need to add new certificate pointing to your website here in my case it's
**\*.nischal-dahal.com.np**, here I don't have .com domain so i am using the
country level domain.

![](/images/blog.deploy-bun-elysia-drizzle-flyio-with-wildcard-domain_2024-08-04-10-26-40.png)

You won't be able to see the green dots in verified and rsa, ecdsa check at the
first time, you need to add the \_achme_challange CNAME find out in **Domain
ownership verification** , pointing to the value that is given by fly.io, then
after sometime it will be verified and ready to go.

#### We are ready to hit our api from our own wildcard domain,

if you had looked at the `index.ts` in the src directory, you will see some
simple code, it's just a simple api with bun, where i am getting name of user
from the user database from our neon db, and if found show the hello, message
else no authorized

Example

![](/images/blog.deploy-bun-elysia-drizzle-flyio-with-wildcard-domain_2024-08-04-10-35-13.png)

because test doesnot exists in our database.

I haven't created the seed script, you can create or add the data on your user
table using drizzle-kit studio `npx drizzle-kit studio`

![](/images/blog.deploy-bun-elysia-drizzle-flyio-with-wildcard-domain_2024-08-04-10-37-12.png)

Add record manually, now let's try out `nees.localhost:8080`,

##### Did you know?

> You can use the `subdomain` in localhost.

![](/images/blog.deploy-bun-elysia-drizzle-flyio-with-wildcard-domain_2024-08-04-10-39-42.png)

Now you can also check it on production, it should give you the same result. If
you haven't deployed after changes, you can use `fly deploy`

![](/images/blog.deploy-bun-elysia-drizzle-flyio-with-wildcard-domain_2024-08-04-10-44-14.png)

### Conclusion

We setup, deployed and tested our bun, elysia and drizzle projects on fly.io you
can use other hosting platforms as well, like railway,coolify and many more
