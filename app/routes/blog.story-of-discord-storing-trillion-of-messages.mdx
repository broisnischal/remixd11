In 2017, discord shared how they were able to store billions of message, also
they shared their journey of how they started MongoDB but migrated their data to
Cassandra because they were looking for a database that was scalable,
fault-tolerant, and relatively low maintenance. Discordâ€™s decision was to
migrate from MongoDB to Cassandra due to the rapidly growing chat messages and
the need for a more scalable database. Discord had to understand their
read/write patterns to choose the right database. They defined their
requirements, which included linear scalability, automatic failover, low
maintenance, proven to work, predictable performance, not a blob store, and open
source. Cassandra was the only database that fulfilled all their requirements.

Discord chose Cassandra because it is a KV (Key-Value) store with a partition
key and clustering key that allows for powerful data modeling. Discord used
channel_id as the partition key and message_id (a Snowflake) as the clustering
key to make range scanning for messages more efficient. Overall, Cassandra was a
good choice for Discord because it allowed for easy distribution around the
cluster, minimum seeks, and self-healing capabilities.

Discord now switched from Cassandra to ScyllaDB,

how a messaging company started with MongoDB but switched to Cassandra to store
billions of messages, hoping for a database that was scalable, fault-tolerant,
and low maintenance. However, as their data grew to trillions of messages across
177 nodes, they faced serious performance issues, including unpredictable
latency, maintenance operations that were too expensive to run, and hot
partitions that led to struggles for the cluster.

To address these issues, they migrated to ScyllaDB, a Cassandra-compatible
database written in C++, which promised better performance, faster repairs, and
stronger workload isolation via its shard-per-core architecture. Despite being a
big cluster, with trillions of messages and nearly 200 nodes, they migrated
every database but one to ScyllaDB, as they gained more experience with it in
production, used it in anger, and learned its pitfalls.

They worked to improve ScyllaDB performance for their use case, including
optimizing its use of resources and tuning its settings, and were able to
maintain their message schema and continue to use Snowflake IDs to sort messages
chronologically. With ScyllaDB, they were able to eliminate the garbage
collector issues that had caused significant latency spikes and stability issues
with Cassandra.

Overall, the article highlights the challenges of scaling a database to handle
massive amounts of data, the importance of finding the right database for your
use case, and the value of experimenting with and learning from new
technologies.
