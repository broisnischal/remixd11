Deployment of application is constantly evolving and changing a lot. Sticking
with the single one is quite difficult. In this post, I will share with you the
best place to host your modern applications in 2024.

We have bunch of options, like serverless, long lived servers, cloud hosting,
edge computing, container hosting, Paas, VPS, dedicated hosting, etc.

## Recommendations

We have a lot of options to choose from. In this post, I won't sway you to use
the specific hosting platform, but instead we are going through each and every
one brief and what better and not better to choose.

Remember, it's highly advisable to keep your server and database as close as
possible. This might be the single most important performance factor. Hosting
your app on Vercel and having each loader and action call an API server hosted
somewhere else is going to throttle your app's performance punitively.

- Serverless
- Long lived servers
- Cloud hosting
- Edge computing
- Container hosting
- VPS
- Dedicated hosting
- Services
- Other hosts
- Freetier hosting

### Serverless functions

Serverless functions are a form of managed hosting where application code is
started and stopped on demand at request-time. Sometimes entire applications fit
in a single function, or an app can be distributed across many, with each
endpoint being its own function.

- often billed by the number of requests, the amount of time the function is
  running, and the amount of memory the function uses

- can scale up to handle large amounts of traffic, and scale back down when
  traffic resumes to normal levels

- often run in normal datacenters, but others run on an edge network, which
  means they run in datacenters all over the world, close to the end user

- often run Node.js, but "edge" functions run on the very fast, but less
  supported, V8 runtime

Because of the ephemeral nature of these functions, the first request to a
function may cause a cold-start and take several seconds to respond. We will go
through each serverless platform one by one.

### 1. Cloudflare

Cloudflare Pages is a hosting service, like Netlify or Vercel, but built on
Cloudflare's network. You get a git based deploy workflow and preview
deployments for different branches.

Static content is hosted from Cloudflare's CDN and the rest of the Remix app is
compiled into a single cloudflare worker on the edge. Vercel's edge functions
are built on top of Cloudflare workers. which uses the V8 runtime, so they
aren't compatible with many node modules.

Cloudflare supports the additional CDN-Cache-Control header for making CDN
specific cache settings.

Cloudflare supports a request body size of 100MB for most apps, but if you need
more, you can request a limit increase. This is higher than any other serverless
platform. Websockets also work on Cloudflare, which is not common for serverless
platforms.

Supports:

- Git based deploys
- Static assets
- Deploy previews
- Websockets
- Bundle size (25 MB)
- Request body size (100 MB)
- Image CDN
- Colocated databases - SQL, KV, Blob

### 2. Vercel

Vercel is a serverless hosting platform for web apps.

They support git-based deployments, and deploy previews for every branch and
pull request, as well as some fancy collaboration tools built on top.

Vercel allows you to specify whether to use a Node runtime or a V8 Edge runtime
on a per-page basis, so you can use Node functions for some pages and V8
functions for others.

As Vercel splits each endpoint into its own function, the 50MB limit for each
function bundle becomes very hard to hit.

- Vercel does not support websockets, and while it does support streaming,
  connections can only be open for 30s so Server-Sent Events aren't practical.
- Full cache-control support, including stale-while-revalidate and
  stale-if-error, as well as the s-maxage property.
- The maximum request body size with Vercel is 4.5MB, which can be problematic
  for direct file uploads.

Vercel supports several colocated databases, including Vercel Postgres, Vercel
KV, and Vercel Blob.

### 3. Netfliy

Netlify is the original JAMStack hosting platform that has grown from a simple
static site host to a full-featured serverless platform.

With built-in git-based deployments, every time you push to your git repo,
Netlify will build and deploy your app. You can also use deploy previews to test
your app before merging a pull request.

Netlify supports both Node (Netlify functions) and V8 (Netlify Edge Functions)
runtimes as separate targets, so your entire app will run on one or the other.

On node, you can choose which region your functions are deployed to, but you
can’t deploy to multiple regions at once. Edge functions are always
multi-region.

Edge functions also allow server-sent events on Netlify

Netlify supports powerful fine-grained cache control in a few ways

- Cache-Tag headers which can be used to invalidate specific pages or assets
- Netlify-Vary header, which can vary cache policies on specific headers, like
  device type, or specific cookie values, like user sessions or A/B tests.

They also support Blob Storage for colocated file storage

### 4. Fastly

Fastly is a powerful CDN and hosting platform and the hosting provider of choice
for the Remix + React Router docs.

Fastly supports Remix with their Compute@Edge platform. This is a serverless
platform that runs on the edge, compiling Typescript down to WebAssembly. Rather
than V8, like most edge functions, or Node, like everything else.

Fastly has full cache-control header support, including stale-while-revalidate
and stale-if-error. For more control, they also offer the Surrogate-Control
header for making CDN specific settings.

They also offer APIs to programmatically purge the cache, which is not common.

Fastly has support for websockets, which is not common for serverless platforms.

- Because it doesn't run node, many node modules are not compatible with Remix
  on Fastly. In exchange, you get the current fastest possible runtime.
- Fastly supports a 100MB compiled bundle size limit, measured after compilation
  to WASM and after all compiler optimizations have been applied.
- No git based deployments, but easy to deploy in GitHub Actions

Fastly supports colocated KV storage deployed alongside your app.

### 5. SST

SST is an infrastructure-as-code framework for building serverless applications
on AWS.

SST converts your infrastructure code into a series of API calls to your cloud
providers. Behind the scenes it uses Pulumi and Terraform, more on this below.
Your SST config is a description of the infrastructure that you are trying to
create as a part of your project. In our case we’ll be defining Lambda
functions, API Gateway endpoints, DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, etc.

- Git based deploys are not included, but you can easily set up your own with a
  Github Action or by using Seed, the deployment infrastucture tool.
- Preview and staging environments are created via the SST CLI, which you can do
  in a Github Action.

### 6. Deno deploy

Deno Deploy is a solid solution for developers seeking a fast, secure, and
easy-to-use platform for deploying serverless JavaScript applications. It serves
as a worldwide platform for serverless JavaScript applications, ensuring that
your JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly code operates on managed servers
located near your users. This setup enables quick response times and low
latency. Instead of virtual machines, applications are powered by the Deno
runtime and run on efficient V8 engines, making the deployment process fast and
lightweight.

- Build Logs
- Build Cancellation
- Analytics
- Data Storage ( BuiltIn KV for simple data persistance )
- Edge Functions integrations
- Native Build Plugins
- Background Functions
- Serverless Functions (API)
- Bandwidth 100GB/month

### Long lived servers

A more traditonal approach to application hosting is to run your application on
a long-lived server. The server (or servers) remain running and handle requests
as they come in.

- no cold start time, so the first request is as fast as any other

- can be more expensive than serverless during low traffic

- you can run a database on the same server, so you don't need to worry about
  network latency

- most of these platforms also support deploying managed Redis and Postgres
  databases

- can have full access to the file system, to spawning child processes, to
  streaming responses, deferred data, server-sent events, running websocket
  servers in parallel with your app, and more

Git based deploys, preview environments, staging environments, Static assets
CDN, Multi region deployments, etc. `Here are major best platforms` listed with
it's description.

### Coolify

Coolify is an all-in one PaaS that helps you to self-host your own applications,
databases or services (like Wordpress, Plausible Analytics, Ghost) without
managing your servers, also known as an open-source & self-hostable Heroku /
Netlify / Vercel alternative.

- `Any Language:` Launch websites, APIs, backends, and more.
- `Any Server:` Deploy to any server with SSH, including VPS and cloud.
- `Any Use Case:` Single or multi-server, Docker Swarm deployments.
- `Push to Deploy:` Git integration with popular platforms.
- `Free SSL:` Automatic Let’s Encrypt setup and renewal.
- `Auto DB Backups:` Backup to any S3-compatible solution.
- `Webhooks:` CI/CD pipeline integration with custom tools.
- `PR Deployments:` Auto-deploy commits and pull requests.
- `Server Automations:` Automate server tasks.
- `Monitoring:` Track deployments, servers, and get alerts.
- `Notifications:` Receive alerts via Discord, Telegram, and email.

### Fly.io

Fly.io is a managed container platform that runs on the edge. Not serverless
functions, but serverless virtual machines.

One of Fly's biggest advantages is its multi-region support. You can deploy your
app to any of Fly's 20+ regions, and Fly will automatically replicate your app
to every region you deploy to. This means that your app will be closer to your
users, and will be more resilient to outages.

- There is no built in git based deployments, but easy to set up in GitHub
  Actions
- No preview environments. You can use FlyCD for automatic preview environments
  on Fly.io
- Fly has an 8GB uncompressed docker image limit
- Fly has a 10MB request body buffer, but can handle larger bodies by streaming
  them

### Heroku

Heroku, arguably the most popular of them all is a container-based cloud
Platform as a Service (PaaS). It is an elegant, flexible, and easy-to-use
service that enables developers to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps.

Heroku Key Features:

- Build and deploy.
- Private space – offers an isolated network, and dedicated runtime environments
  for enhanced privacy, power, and performance.
- Seamless and detailed access controls that give managers control, and ensure
  users have the access they need.
- SSO – it supports several identity providers such as Salesforce Identity,
  Okta, PingOne, Microsoft Active Directory, or PingFederate to manage -
  developer access and authorization.
- Offers a single dashboard for managing your teams, resources, and performance,
  in different stages of development.
- Provides enterprise-grade support with highly responsive SLAs, plus expert
  help with scaling, application architecture design, white-glove onboarding,
  and so much more.

### Render

Render is a managed hosting platform that supports Remix without needing Docker,
though you still have the ability to package your app as a Docker image if you
have special dependencies you want to install.

Render supports git based deployments, so you just need to push code to your git
repo and Render will deploy it. They also support preview environments for their
Team plans.

- There is no multi-region support like Fly
- Render has no request body size limit
- They don't seem to have published their bundle/image limits

### Railway

Railway is a managed container hosting platform. If you don't supply your own
Dockerfile, Railway will let you deploy without it.

Railway supports git based deployments, so you just need to push code to your
git repo and Railway will deploy it. They also support preview environments for
their Team plans.

For databases, Railway has built-in support for Postgres, MySQL, Redis, and
MongoDB, and they have a web UI for managing them as well.

- Railway supports deploying to different continental regions, but no
  multi-region support like Fly
- No automatic preview environments, but it's easy to set up staging
  environments

### DigitalOcean

DigitalOcean App Platform is a managed container hosting platform. If you don't
supply your own Dockerfile, DigitalOcean will let you deploy without it.

DigitalOcean supports git-based deployments and also offers a Github action for
more advanced deployment workflows.

- Postgres, MySQL, Redis, and MongoDB databases can be deployed from the
  DigitalOcean web console alongside your application.
- No automatic preview environments or built-in staging environments

### Layer0

Layer0 is designed for developers aiming to build and deploy high-performance
websites and apps with ease. It focuses on optimizing both static and dynamic
content delivery through edge computing, providing fast load times and seamless
integration with modern frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, and more.

### Cloud hosting

Cloud hosting provides flexibility and scalability by allowing you to deploy
your application on a network of virtual servers hosted in the cloud. This is
the go-to solution for most modern applications.

- Scalability: Easily scale up or down based on traffic demands, with load
  balancers distributing traffic efficiently across multiple instances.

- Cost-effective: Pay only for the resources you use, making it cost-effective
  for startups and growing businesses.

- Reliability: High uptime guarantees with built-in redundancy and failover
  mechanisms.

- Managed services: Many cloud providers offer managed databases, caching
  services, and other infrastructure components, reducing the need for manual
  management.

### Edge computing

Edge computing is a form of cloud hosting that allows you to deploy your
application on a network of virtual servers hosted in the cloud. This is the
go-to solution for most modern applications, also brings the computing power
closer to the user by running applications on servers located near the end-user,
rather than in a centralized data center.

- Low latency: By processing data closer to where it’s generated, edge computing
  significantly reduces latency, making it ideal for real-time applications.
- Distributed architecture: Edge computing uses a network of micro data centers,
  which enhances reliability and fault tolerance.
- Better data security: Sensitive data can be processed locally, minimizing
  exposure to centralized servers and reducing risks.

Popular platforms: Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, AWS Lambda@Edge.

### Container hosting

Container hosting leverages containerization to deploy applications in isolated
environments. Containers bundle an application with all its dependencies,
ensuring consistent performance across different environments. Container hosting
is a form of cloud hosting that allows you to deploy your application on a
network of virtual servers hosted in the cloud.

- Portability: Containers can run consistently on any environment that supports
  containerization, from local development to production.
- Resource efficiency: Containers share the host system's resources, making them
  lightweight and faster to start compared to virtual machines.
- Microservices-friendly: Containers are perfect for deploying microservices,
  where each service runs in its own isolated environment.
- Orchestration: Tools like Kubernetes manage the deployment, scaling, and
  management of containerized applications, automating much of the operational
  workload.

Popular platforms: Docker, Kubernetes, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon
Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

### VPS (Virtual Private Server)

A VPS provides a dedicated portion of a physical server, offering more control
and customization than shared hosting while being more cost-effective than a
dedicated server.

- Dedicated resources: You have guaranteed CPU, RAM, and storage, improving
  performance consistency.

- Full control: You get root access to the server, allowing you to install
  custom software, configure the environment, and manage security settings.

- Scalability: Easily upgrade your VPS plan as your application's resource needs
  grow.

- Cost: VPS is often cheaper than cloud hosting for consistent, predictable
  workloads.

Popular platforms: DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, AWS Lightsail.

### Dedicated Hosting

Dedicated hosting provides a physical server dedicated solely to your
application. This option offers the highest level of performance, control, and
security, making it suitable for large-scale, resource-intensive applications.

- Maximum performance: With no shared resources, you get the full power of the
  server, which is ideal for high-traffic websites or applications.
- Full control: You have complete control over the server environment, including
  the OS, hardware, and software stack.
- Security: Dedicated servers provide the highest level of security since no
  other tenants are on the same machine.

Popular platforms: Bluehost Dedicated, HostGator Dedicated, OVHcloud.

## Services

##### `Platform as a Service (PaaS)`

PaaS provides a complete platform for developing, running, and managing
applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. This allows
developers to focus solely on writing code.

- Simplified deployment: Deploy applications with minimal configuration, often
  with just a git push.
- Integrated services: PaaS platforms typically offer built-in services like
  databases, caching, and CI/CD pipelines, streamlining the development process.
- Auto-scaling: Automatically adjusts resources based on the application's
  traffic, ensuring high availability and performance.
